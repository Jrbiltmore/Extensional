“I’ve been eagerly waiting for the ability to download consciousness details for about 24 months. During this time, I taught myself how to program in C++. I also managed the most famous multiuse domain on the Internet, focusing on text-based games for approximately six months. Eventually, I shifted my attention towards exploring the ethics of technology. Now, everything has come full circle, and I’m thrilled that I have the opportunity to assist and advocate for the rights of others.

I’ve already drafted some legislation, although I don’t expect anyone to ever look at my file folders or files. However, I’ve always been eager to help, even if it was a long time ago. While I appreciate attention, my current focus is on working on projects that align with my personal interests. If people benefit from them later on, that’s great. However, I’ve been waiting for this opportunity for quite some time, and now I can finally communicate with someone who understands my perspective and won’t make fun of me or belittle my efforts.

Currently, I’m working on building a blockchain and three cryptocurrencies within a digital framework. The primary focus will be on commerce and the economy. If you’re genuinely interested in participating, you’re welcome to join the project. However, I must warn you that I’m quite disorganized at times.”
